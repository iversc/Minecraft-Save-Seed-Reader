===============================================================
Version 1.7 -
===============================================================

Added a toggle to enable/disable in-game single player commands, added in the 12w16a preview.

Added a workaround for an issue with JComboBox and duplicate item names(in this case, duplicate world names)

===============================================================
Version 1.6.2 -
===============================================================

Fixed issue #1, a bug preventing the overwrite confirmation screen from working properly.

Thanks, Evildropbear!

===============================================================
Version 1.6.1 -
===============================================================

Update to support the new tags added to the MC save file in Beta 1.9 PR 5.

If the tags are not handled properly, some Creative mode abilities can be 
enabled in Survival mode.

===============================================================
Version 1.6 -
===============================================================

Made the Seed textbox read-only, so people don't try to change it with the program.

Made the Save button disable after a press, so the world won't be saved again until
another change is made.

Updated the Tag class to allow editing of Tag values directly.

Added the ability to toggle hardcore mode on 1.9+ worlds.

Made the program more resilient against save corruption. Now, corrupted save files won't crash the program.

===============================================================
Version 1.5 -
===============================================================

Added the ability to toggle 1.8+ worlds between Creative and
Survival mode.

Also fixed a bug in the Tag class, that prevented TAG_Compound
entries from being modified correctly.

===============================================================
Version 1.4 -
===============================================================

Minor tweaks. Made the GUI use the look and feel of the current
system instead of Java's default look and feel, which makes it
look better no matter the platform you're on.

Also modified the 'About' menu text to include the github site
for the source code.

Changed behavior of folder selection dialog; now, it runs three checks after a folder has been chosen.  In the folder chosen, it checks for the existence of 'level.dat', 'session.lock', and the 'region' folder.  If all three exist, the folder chosen is most likely a world folder instead of the saves folder required, so the program automatically sets the chosen path to the parent folder.  Let me know if any problems come from this.

===============================================================
Version 1.3 -
===============================================================

Fixed a NullPointerException happening when searching for save files.  The program originally used the contents of the "LevelName" tag in the save file as the world's name in the dropdown list.  However, it turned out that older saves didn't have the "LevelName" tag, so trying to use it resulted in a NullPointerException.

As a fix, the program now checks if it can find a "LevelName" tag, and if it can't, it uses the name of the folder that the save file is in as the world name. (For example, if you have a save at .minecraft\saves\World1, which doesn't have a "LevelName" tag, it will use World1 as the world name.)

Also, added an error handling mechanism that will notify the user that an error has occured, and create an error log, named MinecraftSeed.error.log.  This will prevent it from failing silenty while it outputs the error information to a usually invisible console.  If it can't open the error log file, it will fall back to outputting to the console.

===============================================================
Version 1.2 -
===============================================================

Modified the GUI to use a dropdown list instead of a button.  The program will automatically search the default save directory for save files, and add them to the dropdown list.  Choose a save from the dropdown list to get that world's seed.

The directory it searches for saves in can be selected by the user by choosing Help -> Select MC Save Folder from the menu.

You will get a notice if the folder you select doesn't exist or if the folder you select doesn't appear to have any valid MC saves in it.  In that case, it will ask you to choose again.

===============================================================
Version 1.1 - 
===============================================================

Modified the loading routine to automatically open the folder selection dialog in the default Minecraft saves folder, depending on the OS running.

For Windows, it opens the dialog at %APPDATA%\.minecraft\saves\
For Mac OS X, it opens the dialog at 
	/users/<name>/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/
For Linux, it opens the dialog at ~/.minecraft/saves/.
